Building Lantern on Windows
===========================

In this tutorial, I assurme you are on a 64-bit Windows system.

If you are runing a 32-bit Windows, you'll have to make some modifications to the commands, such as replacing all ``x86_64`` with ``i386``, yet I have no idea how many modifications in exact are needed to make it work. It is also possible to build a 32-bit version of Lantern with a 64-bit Windows, and there is a relevant discussion in the last subsection of this section.
